# Design notes

Why some non-obvious parts of this server look the way they do. Written while building a design system with it: cloning 19 components to another page and giving each a wireframe variant.

## Why `run_script` exists

Atomic tools cost one call per node, and batching with `node_ids[]` only helps when every node gets the *same* value. Real jobs compute per node. Recolouring that cloned design system meant deriving each grey from the original colour's luminance: 197 fill writes and 85 stroke writes across 288 nodes. No combination of parameters expresses that.

Measured on that job: **~25 calls with `run_script`, ~80+ without** — and without it the model must also pull all 288 nodes' fills into context to group them.

Contrary to a common assumption, Figma's plugin sandbox **does** allow dynamic code (`new Function`). Scripts can `await`, and returning a live node is rejected rather than breaking the bridge.

Prefer the atomic tools for single edits: their errors point at one node, while a failed script can leave the document half-changed.

## Why mutating tools are quiet

They return `{ok, ids}`. A 50-node batch echoing a full node summary each buries whatever the caller was doing. `verbose: true` restores the summaries.

## Why every scope is named

Tools act on the page the user currently has open, and the user can switch pages mid-session. That silently changes what a call operates on — `find_nodes` once returned nodes from a different page while the intended page was empty. So `find_nodes` reports the `scope` it searched and accepts a `page`, and `list_pages` / `set_current_page` make the target explicit.

## Figma API behaviour worth knowing

These cost real debugging time; the handlers now absorb them.

- **`combineAsVariants` stacks variants** at the same coordinates, and a `COMPONENT_SET` **never grows to fit its children**. Two silent failures at once: variants overlap, the overflow is clipped, and the symptom looks like a broken clone. `combine_as_variants` lays them out and resizes.
- **Set bounds update lazily.** Reading `width`/`height` right after moving children returns the old value; re-read in a later call.
- **The sandbox has no filesystem or network.** Anything touching either belongs in the Go server — see `download_assets`, `import_image`, `get_screenshot`.
- **Instance children have derived ids** of the form `I<instance-id>;<source-child-id>`. Tools accept them.

## Why screenshots report their scale

Output is capped so a huge page cannot return a multi-megabyte payload. A 9336 px frame came back as a 139×2000 thumbnail that looked like a real screenshot, so `get_screenshot` now reports the scale it applied and the source height, and takes `max_dimension`.
